- CONV-INT8: BUILT AND NOT WORKING, INACTIVE BY DEFAULT (Exp685). Everything the design needed is in
  the tree and nothing ships: converter (.auto/conv_int8.py + quant4x4.cpp), runtime path
  (vae_conv_1d_i8 + metadata-only geometry carrier + K=row/IC kernel-size derivation), auto-detected
  from the weight layout so an F16 file takes the old path (default transcript byte-identical).
  Result on device: vae_s 16.2-16.4 vs 17.1 baseline (-5%, the predicted win is REAL) but the output
  is garbage - 1024 '!' tokens with a pre-converted Q8_0 src1, 9 tokens if ggml converts F32->Q8_0
  itself (the LM's route). So the dots are fast and the features are wrong.
  WHAT IS RULED OUT: geometry (the im2col node is structurally identical to the working F16 path -
  same 3-D [K,IC,OC] shape, same params); the F16-vs-F32 unfold (both garbage); the padding/cache
  path (untouched); kernel-size derivation (verified head K=8 = 16384/2048).
  WHAT IS UNRESOLVED: whether the CONVERTER bytes or the RUNTIME's reading of them are wrong, because
  the tool that should have answered - .auto/conv_roundtrip.py, a Python dequantizer - FAILS ITS
  POSITIVE CONTROL (run against llama-quantize's own q4_0_4x4 tensors, which are known good, it
  reports max|err| ~= the full weight scale). Its scales decode correctly (d[0] = max|x|/8 exactly,
  per row, so block_q4_0x4 = d[4] then qs[64] and the 4-row grouping are right) - so the remaining
  unknown is precisely the nibble-to-element map. Fix the checker against the control FIRST (the
  brute force has covered byte order {interleaved, row-major} x value map {nibble-8, signed4}; the
  untried variants are the nibble-half swap and an offset permutation inside the 4-byte group), and
  only then trust a verdict about the file.
  LESSON (6th "the measurement you ran wasn't the measurement you meant"): I nearly concluded from a
  failing checker that a correct-looking converter was broken. The positive control cost 3 minutes
  and would have been run earlier if I had treated a new checker as guilty until proven innocent -
  which is Exp660's rule, applied to a tool I wrote in the same iteration.
